# Running the Room Dashboard app

This app uses Yarn as its package manager, it should work with npm as well but for project safety I added the `package-lock.json` file to the ignore list.

To run the application you must first install the dependencies using the following command:

`yarn install`

After this has completed, you should be able to run this next command:

`yarn start`

The applcation will likely open the browser window for you, but in case it doesn't you can open the following link in your browser:

[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
