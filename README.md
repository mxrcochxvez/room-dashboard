# Setting up the app

The api key was not included in this project for security reasons. You will need to provide the api key in the following file if you want to run/use the application.

`src/env/apiKey.ts`

All you need to do is add the key in between the quotation marks.

# Running the app

This app uses Yarn as its package manager, it should work with npm as well but for project safety I added the `package-lock.json` file to the ignore list.

To run the application you must first install the dependencies using the following command:

`yarn install`

After this has completed, you should be able to run this next command:

`yarn start`

The applcation will likely open the browser window for you, but in case it doesn't you can open the following link in your browser:

[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
